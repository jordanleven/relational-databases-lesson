# Relational Databases Lesson

This project is to show the power of relational databases in mySQL.

## Running the database

To start up the database, make sure Docker is running on your computer and run `docker-compose up`. This will start up your database and seed it with the required data (if it hasn't already been initialized).

## Connecting to the database

In your database client of choice, connect to the database using the following credentials:

**Hostname:** `localhost`\
**Port:** `18766`\
**User:** `user`\
**Password:** `movielover`
